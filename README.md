# We took raw fish data and piped it to create a new column with fish lengths >300
# We then added a second pipe and filtered out scale lengths <1mm
# Finally we added a histogram comparing scale length and length. Color coded by Lake ID.
# Renamed data so it is now numbered '_1.csv'
# Pushed changes to GitHub
